# DMTM_BreadbasketProject
## Executive Summary

The BreadBasket dataset is a list of transactions from a grocery store of some kind. Our team decided to use the arules and arulesViz libraries in RStudio to conduct an analysis of this dataset. We started off with some basic data exploration. We looked at the head and tail of the dataset, sorted by time, to look at some of the items bought in the morning and some of the items bought at night. This also served as a reference-point for attribute names and types. Then, the main data file was split into 3 additional files: MorningData, AfternoonData, and EveningData. These would later be used to conduct arules analysis of those individual time frames. After some exploration of the new datasets, arules analysis began. First, item frequency plots of all 4 datasets were made. Then, each dataset had to be converted to a proper transactional dataset to work with the apriori function. After running each one through the function, we were able to inspect the generated rules by lift and by count to see which rules were the most likely to occur and which ones occured the most. Finally, we used arulesViz to create network diagrams of the rules and look for clusters of items.
